Homework #1

For this project I refactored the HTML to utilize semantic HTML5 elements to give the code more meaning and logical structure. To do this I replaced most div elements with more specific and meaningful elements, or, semantic elements that meet the current HTML5 standards. Because of this implementation the code is more accessible and readable, and generally higher in quality. In addition I added alt attributes to each image as requested, and changed the title to be more descriptive. 

I also tightened up the CSS stylesheet by consolidating repetitive code blocks.
